    <p>The benefits of having IT tools and the system is that it makes certain things easier to do, the drawbacks are that there are programs that does occasionally crashes or freezes.</p> 
    <p>I would track your tasks and see what you have done and see what needs to be done. I would also try and limit my distractions from anything.</p>
    <p>I would add a different colour to the text in the body. I would also add animations and videos to the website, to make it more attractive.</p>
    <p>I would use the internet browser or other programs to test and see if the solution is working as intended. If it fails, I would go over to see what I typed wrong.</p>
