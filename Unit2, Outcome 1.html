    <h1>Unit 2, Outcome 1</h1>
    <p>The layout is easy and simple and the content is easy and big to read. The design is very simple. There's no fancy stuff, like animations, so there's not much apart from a few paragraphs and a picture with a link. I put a simple layout, because I didn't wan it to be complicated and confusing.</p>
    <p>Copyright can be a big issue for website developers, as there are countries that doesnâ€™t allow certain contents to be shown. Time constraints can also be an issue as well, since there are developers that need to work late or over-time to edit the website and get it back up and running.</p>
    <p>People with certain disabilities may have difficulty accessing the website. For example, if you are blind or deaf. We can make the website easier to access, by making it simple and big. People can also hear what the website says by using the voice-over feature.</p>
    <p>I think the appropriate file type in terms on picture is JPEG, as it's got a really small size. For video, I was chosen MP4. It's the most common file type and the images are in very good quality.</p>
