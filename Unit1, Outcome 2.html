    <h1>Unit 1, Outcome 2</h1>
    <p>I am happy with the tools that I used to make my website.  I found them to be interesting to use, as I learned them. It has also helped me to put certain features, that I think looked better.</p>
    <p>I think Visual Studio Code is appropriate to use; I think it help me to create my website with no issues. It has also helped me to put more into the website.</p>
    <p>I think the strength of the website is that it has colour and a clickable picture, I think the weakness to the website is that it would include animations. I’m happy with my website, because it’s simple and easy. It also doesn’t have too much on it to a point where it would run slow.</p>
    <p>I would improve my project further by adding gif files into my website, to make it more attractive. I would also add more links, next to the title.</p>
    <p>I think the outcome meets the requirements, because it’s got a simple layout and it’s easy to read and navigate.</p>
